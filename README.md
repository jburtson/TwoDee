Side scrolling Unity game prototype. Inclosed is an .exe of the game, a screenshot, and my scripts. The game itself includes three characters with pixel art done with photoshop, and animation done with Unity, and seamless looped music cut by myself in Audacity. In it the player controls the astronaut “Naut” who can shoot, wall jump, and must breath oxygen or suffocate.
